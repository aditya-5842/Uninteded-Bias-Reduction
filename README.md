# Uninteded-Bias-Reduction
<b>Requirement</b>:
* Python3
* TensorFlow 1.x

I've uploaded both .ipynb and .py files. .py files can be used to train and report the model. 
* <b>`models.py`</b>: this file will creates the functions that I've used for final prediction.
* <b>`functions.py`</b>: this file has reqiured function for data pre-processing, designing new features and to caluculate final metric
* <b>`train.py`</b>:this file will train the models and save them then it'll report the perfomance of model for train/CV/test dataset.
* <b>`Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification.ipynb`</b>: this file has all details form starting to end. Exploaratory Data Analysis, hyperparamter tunning of models is done is this file.
